### idea 

An apartment hunting app that makes it easier for anyone to find spaces to rent. I would like to add a way for both landlords to offer spaces and tenants to browse these spaces based on filters like price, kitchen, privacy, and more. The communication should be all done on the app and not email or phone.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
